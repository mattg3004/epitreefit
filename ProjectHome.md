Source code provided here allows users to fit epidemiological models to phylogenies using coalescent based methods. These methods, often referred to as "phylodynamics", allow model parameters and population dynamics to be estimated from genetic data through a genealogy. The algorithm implemented within will be described in a forthcoming paper in Molecular Biology and Evolution by the author. For background on the coalescent models used for inference, see Volz (Genetics, 2012).
